# Guessing Game In RUST

Set up the file using _CARGO_

```bash
cargo new <file-name> // to create
cargo run // to check if the program is running
```

## Notes

1. We create varibales in rust by using the _let_ keyword
2. ::new() => is a function which is used here on the string type and its an associated function or static methods , the ::new() returns
   an empty string that we can use
3. Variables are **Immutable** by default , we can change the immutable variables to mutable by explicitly mentioning it by the term **mut**
